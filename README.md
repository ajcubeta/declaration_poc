# Declaration Form POC

A sample demo for Declaration Form with ActiveRecord validation.

## Version
* I'm using 1.9.3-p551 to replicate the current POC set-up

## FM and Mysql set-up
* I use local FM (filemaker) settings to connect to our in-house server.
* I use MysqlDB to create single migration for testing.

## Run and view the app

* just run the command 'rails server'.
* visit http://localhost:3000/
* play around the form.
* then submit.
